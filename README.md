# React Four

This is a simple Connect Four-game written in React. I've been tinkering on this as my sandbox while learning React so apologies if there's a lot of redundancy, over-complicated expressions or otherwise. If you're one of the anal ones: Feel free to send a pull-request, that way I get to learn even more.

## Learning-tips

**Praise where praise is due:** I almost entirely learned React from [Academinds Maximillian Schwartzm√ºller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) who is, to my mind, the best remote Javascript teacher on the internet. 

**For a the other side of Javasript:** the technical underbelly which noone talks about but causes as all the confusion and frustration about *"this", scope, type-coercion*, the flexible use of functions and so on I recommend Kyle Simpsons ["You don't know JS yet"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
