# React Four

## About

This is a simple Connect Four-game written in React. I've been tinkering on this as my sandbox while learning React so apologies for redundancy, over-complicated expressions and the mix of old and new syntax etc. This is in no way my attempt at writing top-level React-code. It's me playing, learning, trying things out etc.


## How to
Assumes you have Node.js and NPM or Yarn installed.

* Clone or download the project. 
* In  your command prompt navigate to the project folder
* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies - a node_modules-folder should appear.
* Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

## Learning-tips

**Praise where praise is due:** I almost entirely learned React from [Academinds Maximillian Schwartzm√ºller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) who is, to my mind, the best remote Javascript teacher on the internet. 

**For the other side of Javasript:** the technical underbelly which noone talks about but causes a lot of the confusion and frustration about *"this", scope, type-coercion*, the flexible use of functions and so on I recommend Kyle Simpsons ["You don't know JS yet"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).
